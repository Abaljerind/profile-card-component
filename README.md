## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I really am proud with this one, i actually have no idea that i can use multiple background like this, and i really learn something new. Thanks frontendmentor.io XD

```html
<h1>Some code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
body {
  background: url(../images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg) bottom -800px right -200px no-repeat, url(../images/bg-pattern-top.svg) top -500px left -250px no-repeat;
  background-color: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
}
```

### Continued development

Well, actually for the background in mobile devices i still can't figure how to use it with TailwindCSS, so yes, maybe in the future if i know what i have to do, i would love to give it a try.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this framework and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone who is still learning to use this website.
